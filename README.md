# Marketplace Application - New Features

## Overview

This document provides information about the new features added to the Marketplace application, specifically in the `Products` component. These enhancements aim to improve user experience by allowing easier navigation and interaction with the product listings.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that Git and Node.js are installed on your system.
- Clone the Repository: Use the command `git clone https://github.com/Folawewo/algorand-marketplace.git` to clone the project to your local machine.
- Navigate to the Project Directory: After cloning, use `cd algorand-marketplace` to navigate into the project directory and run `npm install`.

## Features

### 1. Wishlist Feature

The wishlist feature allows users to mark products they are interested in and view them separately in their own wishlist tab.

#### Implementation Details

- A `Wishlist` component is added to the application, allowing users to view all products they have added to their wishlist.
- Each product card has a heart icon that users can click to add or remove the product from their wishlist.
- Wishlist data is stored in the browser's local storage, allowing it to persist across user sessions.
- The `useEffect` hook is used to load the wishlist from local storage when the component mounts.

### 2. Search Functionality

The search feature allows users to quickly find products by their name. As the user types in the search field, the product list updates in real-time to display only those products that match the search term. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where the product list is extensive.

#### Implementation Details

- A search input field is integrated into the `Products` component.
- The `useState` hook is used to manage the search term entered by the user.
- The `useEffect` hook monitors changes to the search term and filters the displayed products accordingly.
- Products are filtered on the client side for real-time responsiveness.

### 3. Sorting by Price

This feature allows users to sort the products by their price in either ascending or descending order. Two buttons are provided for users to select their preferred sorting order.

#### Implementation Details

- Two buttons are added to the `Products` component for sorting: "Sort Ascending" and "Sort Descending."
- The sorting function reorders the products based on the price while preserving other attributes.
- Sorting is performed on the client side and can be instantly switched between ascending and descending.

### 4. Rating System

The rating system allows users to submit a rating for each product they have interacted with. Users can rate products on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. The average rating is displayed on each product to help other users make informed decisions.

#### Implementation Details

- Each product has a `Rating` component that displays the current average rating and allows users to submit their ratings.
- Users can click on the stars to submit a rating for the product. Once submitted, the rating is processed and updated in the blockchain.
- The `rateProductAction` function in `marketplace.js` handles the interaction with the blockchain to update the product's rating.
- After a successful rating submission, the product list is re-fetched to reflect the updated ratings.
- Ratings are calculated as an average, based on the total accumulated rating and the number of ratings submitted.

## Usage

- **Wishlist**: Click the heart icon on any product to add it to your wishlist. Access your wishlist from the dedicated tab to view all your favorite items.
- **Search**: Users can type a product name into the search bar to filter the product list. The list updates dynamically with each keystroke.
- **Sort**: Users can click either the "Sort Ascending" or "Sort Descending" button to reorder the product list based on price.
- **Rate**: Users can rate a product by clicking on the stars in the product's rating component. The average rating is updated once the new rating is submitted and confirmed.
